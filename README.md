This is a SAFE F# project (Suave model, Azure, Fable, Elmish) designed to show integration of Azure Search and Storage within an Elmish application using Bootstrap.

### WARNING!

This is not really ready for consumption. There's no build script yet, and no way to run locally without Azure and inserting data into a search index - and no code showing how to do this! This will be updated in the coming days / weeks.

In the meantime, there are a few up-for-grabs issues if someone does want to help out at this early stage.
